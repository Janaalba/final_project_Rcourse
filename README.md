# 2021 group 10 final project

This is the Github repository for the final project of the DTU course 22100 R for Bio Data Science made by group 10.

The repository contains code for data handling and analysis of metabolomics data, microbiota composition data, gastrointestinal symptoms, and autism symptoms for children with autism from the paper by Sanctuary et al.: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210064#sec011

The analysis can be run end-to-end by running the script 00_doit.R

In this repository, in the doc folder, you will also find an Rmd ioslides presentation presenting an overview of the work and some main findings.

Hope you have fun
